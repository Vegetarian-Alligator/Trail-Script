NEXT TASKS:

Long Term:
Implement more sophisticated mathematicall parsing, like what we do with the print function - COMPLETE
*ADDED: Compartamentalize ALL bracket parsing functions - COMPLETE(ish)



Next steps:
**BUG!!!: Verbs with the same display name will cause the game to do weird things
***BUG!!: public List<String> playersToNames() we need to check for null attributes
***BUG!!: If you are getting a question from a the path and then a question from a verb, I don't think that will be handled correctly by socket_test.html
**!!!  public String getName() { need to examine if this kind of return is a copy or a reference to a private variable!
*Return a "stringlist* from parseBracket - COMPLETE
*Implement modifier for UNIQUE* for (get_attribute) (for example names would have to be unique, the game could then enforce this.) - COMPLETE
    Implement a modifier to make sure that the game throws an appropriate error message when a user trail leads to a .trail file meant for a "park"

*Implement Random Numbers - COMPLETE
*Implement pictures in web mode - COMPLETE
*Implement Verbs
    *Must be Able to do specific actions to the "target" and the "actor"
    *Each must be able to see the others attributes in order to make sure that they can 
    -Verbs should have a "watch" option - for example, they activate when hitoints are zero, or when the players turn starts, ect.
**BUG: VERIFY IF USERS WHO EXIT WHILE WAITING TO REPLY AN HANG THE SERVER!  We need a way to make multiple users be able to perform multiple verbs at the same time, but be thread safe.
  
*Implement the world in a "map" class.  Allow more than one map class, different types, ect.
    -Probably implement watch verbs here, rather than when verbs are first implemented


*Implement a *search* ... checks attributes of all entities or entities matching another certain attribute (for example, "human" or "elf")
*Implement Turn Systems
    -Each map should be running it's own turn system - maps are isolated from each other.
    -Different world times should be allowed for example "turn based" or "real time"
*Impelment an "Inventory" class
    -Should have properties such as "remove"    
    -Players can be in inventory (ie, hiding someone in a suitcase)
    -Inventory should have it's own chat
    -Players should be allowed to have multiple inventories" for example, on inventory is what the player is weilding, the other what they are carrying, ect.
*Implement a "ncast" function (n=broad or narrow or ect)
    -This allows inventory to "talk" (send messages) to players holding it (your pack vibrates)
    -This allows players trapped/hidden somewhere to talk only to whever is carrying them
    -Should allow maps to let all players see something "the map vibrates"
*Implement Retreival of World Variables
*Implement archetypes
    -Archtypes can be changes for objects
    -For example, a "statue" with no verbs might change into a statue "monster"
    -Elf or Dwarf might be an archtype - commands that will be read as the character is assigned stuff
*Impelent *return* if statemets*
*Impelement Timers
*Implement Floating Point Calculations
*Implement some sort of *save* function
*Implement some sort of *PROHIBITED* function for values
*Upgrade "RANDOM" to a "DICE" command as many do
*Change all those instances of parseBracket().get(0) to a getFirst function, for greater security (we ignore double brackets, not detecting the error)
*Automatically update the chat - or make that an option
